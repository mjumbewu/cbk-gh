# Coded By Kids ‚ù§ GitHub

GitHub may turn out to be a great resource for tracking kids' progress on projects. Commit messages can form the basis of a progress journal, as well as a built-in point of reflection after each session. Students can use them to summarize the work completed during the session. Volunteer instructors can refer back through the commit history to see kids process as they have been working on a project. Using the web interface and gh-pages may be a good, gentle introduction before getting into the command line.
